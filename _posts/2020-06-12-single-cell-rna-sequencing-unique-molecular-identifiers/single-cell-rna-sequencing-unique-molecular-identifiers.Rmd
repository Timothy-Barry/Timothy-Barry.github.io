title: "Genomics for Statisticians 3: Single cell RNA sequencing, unique molecular identifiers"
description: |
  Single cell RNA sequencing (sc-RNAseq) provides a snapshot of the transcriptome of a single cell. Sc-RNAseq has emerged as one of the most important technologies in modern genomics. In this post we provide an overview of sc-RNAseq. We also explore the related technology of unique molecular identifiers.
